# Python-challenge

PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset


- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
